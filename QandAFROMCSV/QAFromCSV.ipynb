Else you can follow the second option.\\n\\nOption - 2:\\n\\n1. Reason for the Issue:\\nIn the dim_date table, the date is in dd/mm/yyyy format. Whereas the fact table is in mm/dd/yyyy format. Because of the different formats, causing the issue. Power BI/Excel will likely use your system\\'s default date format whenever you open any file. This could cause the date format issue - dd/mm/yyyy --- mm/dd/yyyy. Please look for this whenever you face issues with values mismatch.\\n\\n2. Steps to resolve:\\n    1. Change the data type of the date column to ‘Date’ if it is in ‘Date/Time’ format. Skip this step if it is already in ‘Date’ format.\\n    2. Create a new custom column in the fact_sales_monthly table. you can name it date_modified or any other name accordingly.\\n    Formula\\n    = Date.ToText([date],\"yyyy\") & \"/\" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Day([date])),2,\"0\") & \"/\" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Month([date])),2,\"0\")\\n    3. change the data type of the above-created column to date.\\n    4. In Power Pivot, Go to the \\'Manage\\' tab and select the \\'Diagram\\' view. Map the date column in the \\'dim_date\\' table with the newly created column in the \\'fact_sales_monthly\\' table.

       " Document(page_content='prompt: What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst\\nresponse: While both business analysts and data analysts work with data, they have different focuses and responsibilities. Here are some key distinctions:\\n\\n1. Focus: Business analysts focus on the business side of things, such as business processes, workflows, and strategies. They use data analysis to identify business problems, opportunities, and solutions. Data analysts, on the other hand, focus on the data itself. They collect, process, and analyze data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.\\n2. Skill set: Business analysts need to have strong communication, problem-solving, and strategic thinking skills, as they often work closely with stakeholders and decision-makers to identify business needs and develop solutions. They also need to have some knowledge of data analysis, such as data visualization and basic statistical analysis. Data analysts, on the other hand, need to have a strong foundation in data analysis and programming skills, such as SQL, Python, etc. They also need to have a good understanding of data visualization and statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.\\n3. Tools: Business analysts typically use tools like spreadsheets, business process modeling software, and business intelligence (BI) tools to analyze data and create reports. Data analysts use more advanced tools like statistical software, programming languages, and database management systems to collect, process, and analyze data.\\n4. Outputs: Business analysts typically produce reports, presentations, and recommendations based on their analysis of the data. Data analysts produce statistical models, visualizations, and reports to help stakeholders understand the data and make informed decisions.\\n\\nI recommend watching this video by Dhaval sir which explained more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFRpbPKTG4&t=1s', metadata={'source': 'What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst', 'row': 50}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"prompt: Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?\\nresponse: Here is the brief explanation.\\n\\nSAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() compares the given period with the exact same period of last year as the name suggests. But it has a limitation like King of the chess board - it can go only compare 1 year backward for a given day, month, week, or quarter. If you want to go backward or forward or if you need to go 3 or 6 months/years/days you need to use DATEADD().\\n\\nDATEADD() is more like the queen of the chessboard. It is very dynamic as it compares a day, month, quarter, year, etc. over any specified no. of time period.\\n\\nPARALLELPERIOD() works exactly like DATEADD() but there is a minor difference. Parallelperiod() does not work dynamically like DATEADD().\\n\\nFor example, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous month's value for dates between 1/5/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare these 12 days with the entire previous month of April 2023 (1/4/2023 - 30/4/2023) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same days (1/4/2023- 12/4/2023).\\n\\nLikewise, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous year's value for dates between 1/1/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare this time period with the entire previous year 2022 (1/1/2022 - 31/12/2022) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same period (1/1/2022- 12/5/2022).\\n\\nRefer this thread for more info: https://discord.com/channels/1090613684163850280/1106528524023648326\", metadata={'source': 'Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?', 'row': 51}),\n",
